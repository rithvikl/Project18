## About the App

Gather is a mobile electronic scrapbook designed to allow users to carry their most precious memories in their pocket. Gather allows users to have a perpetuating record of events by taking pictures, adding comments and sharing them with loved ones.

###Notes

* Tags are used to categorize events. Tags are listed in a comma delimited list for each event. Example: family,summer,picnic

###Features

* Take pictures: Take pictures with your phone and immediately back them up on a persistent storage cloud server.
* Save events: Say something about your picture, give it a title and categories.
* View events: See events that you have previously saved to remember the good times.
* Filter events: Search your events by a particular tag, the category you gave the event when it was created.

## Development Notes

The app is working! New users can register an account and upload photos however there may still be bugs.

1. Registering in the first iteration was difficult because we used text fields to enter the user's birthdate. We changed it to use a date picker dialog.
