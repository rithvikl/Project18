## About the App

Gather is a mobile electronic scrapbook designed to allow users to carry their most precious memories in their pocket. Gather allows users to have a perpetuating record of events by taking pictures, adding comments and sharing them with loved ones.

## Development Notes

The app is not currently complete. Do not use.

1. Registering in the first iteration was difficult because we used text fields to enter the user's birthdate. We changed it to use a date picker dialog.
