We are a team of two Computer Science students working on our Bachelor's. This project is for a mobile applications class and is our first attempt at a mobile app.

## About the App

Gather is a mobile electronic scrapbook designed to allow users to carry their most precious memories in their pocket. Gather allows users to have a perpetuating record of events by taking pictures, adding comments and sharing them with loved ones.

###Features

* Account: An account ensures you will not lose your events by backing up your data on a server.
* Take pictures: Take pictures with your phone and immediately back them up on our (our school's) server.
* Save events: Say something about your picture, give it a title and categories.
* View events: See events that you have previously saved to remember the good times.
* Filter events: Search your events by a particular tag, the category you gave the event when it was created.
* Share: Sharing is caring! Let your friends know how awesome you are by sharing pictures straight from Gather.

## Development Notes

The app is not currently complete. Do not use.

1. Registering in the first iteration was difficult because we used text fields to enter the user's birthdate. We changed it to use a date picker dialog.
